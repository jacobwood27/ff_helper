It's important to remember that it did come in Week 14 when the Jaguars had packed it in for the year, but it's still noteworthy. Their first meeting didn't go nearly as well, as he rushed for just 57 yards on 18 carries and didn't score. The silver lining here is that the Titans are remaining true to what they said about riding Henry this year. Of the 47 touches by Titans running backs this year, Henry has 37 of them, a 78.7 percent share. That number last year was just 51.3 percent. The Jaguars defense has allowed exactly 4.65 yards per carry in each of their first two games, while allowing both the Chiefs and Texans running backs to rush for more than 100 yards, which included fellow power-back Carlos Hyde and his 90 yards on 20 carries last week. Those are very respectable numbers for Hyde who doesn't have anywhere close to Henry's breakaway speed. Henry's seemingly high-touch floor with his breakaway potential combine to equal a solid RB2 in fantasy with an RB1 ceiling.","tag":"start","recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB11"},{"player_id":11645,"player_name":"Le'Veon Bell","player_short_name":"L.

The snap count is also much closer than his owners would like, as he's played 76 snaps compared to 61 for Smith. It doesn't help that they lost their starting right guard for the year and then appeared to lose their starting right tackle last week (though he returned late in the game). Under Frank Reich, the Colts have still yet to allow a 100-yard rusher, though they have allowed a massive 5.50 yards per carry (sixth-most) through two games this season. They've also struggled at defending running backs through the air, as they've allowed 8.36 yards per target (fourth highest mark in the league). It's possible that Freeman has caught them at the perfect time after having two brutal matchups against the Vikings and Eagles to start the year. Freeman has seen double the targets that Smith and has nearly double the carries. The Falcons have to know they'll need Freeman to get going if they want to win games, and this game could help boost some of that confidence. He should be in lineups as a low-end RB2\/high-end RB3 who might surprise given the Colts struggles.","tag":"start","recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB24"},{"player_id":17498,"player_name":"Phillip Lindsay","player_short_name":"P.

Through two weeks, Lindsay has 32 touches while Freeman has 27 of them. Lindsay has played 72 snaps while Freeman has played 71 snaps. Lindsay has run 41 routes while Freeman has run 37 of them (the odd part is that both rank top-18 in routes run among running backs). As you can see, it's a 50\/50 split right now. While Dalvin Cook went bananas against the Packers last week (20\/154\/1), the Packers shut down the Bears run-game the prior week, allowing just 37 yards on 11 carries. The Packers said after the game that they knew if they made Mitch Trubisky beat them, they'd win, which allowed them to key-in on the run. You must wonder if they treat the Broncos and Flacco the same way. Whatever the case, the Broncos are eight-point underdogs while on the road and projected to score just 17 points. When there's a 50\/50 timeshare mixed-in, it's hard to say anyone is more than an iffy RB3. A touchdown would likely be the deciding factor, and it's not any clearer there, as Lindsay has four red zone carries, while Freeman has three of them. Consider both of them just low-end RB3s in this game.","tag":"sit","recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB25"},{"player_id":17245,"player_name":"Royce Freeman","player_short_name":"R.

Before saying it's too early to tell, they allowed a massive 4.95 yards per carry and 7.39 yards per target last year, which both ranked as the second-most in football. Gore had a great matchup with the Giants last week and totaled 83 total yards and a touchdown, finishing as a top-10 option at the running back position.

Johnson has played 66 snaps and totaled 19 touches (15 carries, four receptions) while Hyde has played 62 snaps and totaled 31 touches (30 carries, one reception). While most want that to change, it won't if Hyde continues to average a robust 5.8 yards per carry behind a makeshift offensive line. Johnson is going to have more value in games they fall behind, which oddsmakers expect this week. The Chargers struggled against running backs last year (allowed seventh-most points to them) but particularly in the passing game, as they allowed the second-most PPR points through the air to running backs. They allowed an average of 14.7 PPR points per game through the air alone. Think about that for a second. That amounts to five catches for 67 yards and 0.5 touchdowns per game, on average. While the Colts didn't exploit that in Week 1 (they didn't really need to while rushing for 187 yards), the Lions running backs totaled four catches for 53 yards and a touchdown through the air last week. The timeshare all comes down to gamescript and this one should be a bit different than last week. Johnson is the safer play who's somewhat gamescript-proof, so consider him a decent RB3, especially in PPR formats.","tag":"start","recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"RB34"},{"player_id":9006,"player_name":"Adrian Peterson","player_short_name":"A.

On 26 carries, their offensive line has produced exactly eight yards before contact. Meanwhile, the Bears defense allowed the second-fewest points on the ground to running backs last year. Throughout the entire season, they allowed just 133.6 fantasy points on the ground, or 8.35 points per game. That's ridiculous.
